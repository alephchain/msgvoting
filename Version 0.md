**An agent modeling and simulating a curation and message payment system**
1. The number one criteria is to get long-tail distribution
2. Agent based recognizance system
3. Content is one of 4 properties
4. Agent voting is based upon agent having identical property as content
5. Selection of content to agent is randomly selected

*This does not simulate anything on the Steem blockchain.*
It is only my musings to further refine my understanding of how a social network based upon a blockchain would work.
